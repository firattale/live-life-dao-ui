					Our goal in the seed sale is to raise initial capital, start expanding our team, and build the first Web3 features. At a later point we will launch a LifeLive token to be used in the governance of the DAO. {" "}
				</p>
				<p>
					As a sign of gratitude towards our first supporters, you will receive a Web3 Raver NFT, designed by one of our founders. The NFT also represents your ticket to receive your tokens during the token generation event. Read more about the seed sale in the forthcoming litepaper soon and chat with us in our Telegram group. The seed sale tokens do not have economic value; it is a token that gives you early access to our governance token used to steer the LifeLive DAO. It has no claim on financial rights.
